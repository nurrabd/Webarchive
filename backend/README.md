# Webarchive-backend
task given by fordonsbolaget

Notes:

·  User login is required, credentials must be stored in a MySQL database.

·  No registration form is required, you can insert users via MySQL scripts.

·  Inserted sites should be stored in a CSV file and listed on the same page under the insert form.

·  User can edit and delete already existent sites.

·  The list should look something like this:

o Fordonsbolaget (Edit icon - Delete icon), Facebook (Edit icon - delete icon), Youtube (Edit icon - delete icon)

·  Use bootstrap and font awesome icons for the UI work.

·  Front-end and back-end must be two separate entities, so the UI will be communicating with the backend which is a REST API
